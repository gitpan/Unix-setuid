NAME
    Unix::setuid - Get/set real/effective UID/username via (localizeable)
    variable

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Unix::setuid (from Perl
    distribution Unix-setuid), released on 2014-10-09.

SYNOPSIS
     use Unix::setuid; # exports $RUID, $EUID, $RUSER, $EUSER
     say "Real      UID : $RUID";
     say "Effective UID : $EUID";
     say "Real username : $RUSER";
     say "Effective user: $EUSER";
     {
         # become UID 1000 temporarily
         local $EUID = 1000;
         # same thing
         #local $EUSER = "jajang"; # or 1000
     }
     # we're back to previous UID/user

DESCRIPTION
    This module is inspired by File::chdir and File::umask, using a tied
    scalar variable to get/set stuffs. One benefit of this is being able to
    use Perl's "local" with it, effectively setting something locally.

EXPORTS
  $RUID (real UID)
    This will get/set $<.

  $EUID (effective UID)
    This will get/set $>.

  $RUSER (real user)
    Same as $RUID except you will get username and you can set using
    UID/username. Will return numeric UID if no user exists with that ID.
    Will die if setting to non-existing username.

  $EUSER (effective user)
    Same as $EUID except you will get username and you can set using
    UID/username. Will return numeric UID if no user exists with that ID.
    Will die if setting to non-existing username.

SEE ALSO
    Perl's $< and $>.

    Other modules with the same concept: File::chdir, File::umask,
    Locale::Tie.
